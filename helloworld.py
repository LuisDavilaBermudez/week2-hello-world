# Luis Davila-Bermudez

# write a program that:
# 1. greets the user in English
# 2. asks the user to choose from 1 of 3 spoken languages (pick your favorite languages!) 
# 3. displays the greeting in the chosen language
# 4. exits

# make sure that your code contains comments explaining your logic!

#First it says hello
print('Hello Sir/Madam.')
 print('What is your name?') #Then it asks for your name
myname = input()
 print('Hello, ' + myname) #it then says hello to you in english
  print('What language would you prefer?')#it then asks for your prefered language
language = input()
 print('You have chosen ' + language) #it then tells you what language you chose
 if language == english #it then greets you if you chose a valid language
  print('Hello Sir)
 if language == german
  print('Guten Tag')
 if language == spanish
  print('Hola Senior')
exit
